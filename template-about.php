											<p>Paul Eitel has always had a passion for serving the people around him. Originally from Cameroon, Africa, he grew up in Texas and in Wake Forest, NC. Growing up with a strong Christian background, Paul Eitel has traveled to nearly every continent as a missionary, sharing the gospel of Christ with hundreds, and with a passion to help others change their lives for the better.</p>
											<p>While initially drawn to a military career during his college years at the Citadel, Paul Eitel was offered a promising career at a respected construction firm in Raleigh, NC. Having worked summers in the construction industry since his early high school years, he was excited and confident that this was the path he was to follow. In his ten years as Project Developer, he enjoyed helping clients plan, design, and build more than 85-100 million dollars in projects.</p>
											<p>As the years passed, Paul Eitel felt a strong desire to do something different, which led to the co-founding of Focus Design Builders. Mr. Eitel lives with his wife, Lori, and their three children. Paul has had the pleasure of being able to travel abroad as a missionary, and of serving as the Wake Forest Fire Department Chaplain.</p>
